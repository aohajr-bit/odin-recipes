      <p>Frikadellen, the original hamburger, are served like a flattened meatball with string beans and salad.</p>
      <p>This recipe combines ground pork and beef for a richer flavor and juicy texture.</p>
      <P>Home cooks agree that soaking and crumbling the roll made the patties tender.</P>

      <h2>German Hamburgers (Frikadellen) Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 kaiser roll</li>
          <li>⅔ pound ground beef</li>
          <li>⅓ pound ground pork</li>
          <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
          <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
          <li>1 large egg</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon Hungarian hot paprika (Optional)</li>
          <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
      <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
         <li>Soak kaiser roll in a medium bowl of water for 10 minutes. Drain and squeeze out excess water; crumble into a large bowl.</li> 
         <li>Add ground meats, onion, parsley, egg, paprika, salt, and black pepper to crumbled roll; mix until well blended. Shape mixture into large flattened meatballs.</li>
         <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Fry meatballs in the hot skillet until browned and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a patty should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
